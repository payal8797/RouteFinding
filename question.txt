-----ROUTE FINDING----

Ram and Shyam are two bright students studying in the university, Microbiology Department. Both were busy with an assignment to study the nature of COVID19 virus to see how a vaccination can be created and thought they might be able to finish it in a couple of days and then go to their native place, Chandrapur.

But as the lockdown was imposed immediately the next coming day, they are stuck up in Pune itself and unable to go to their hometown. 

Just a few days back, they both got the permission to travel to their hometown on their bike, but of course with a few restrictions.

The restrictions are as below:

    They need to reach their destination within 5 days.
    If a certain district is in Red Zone, they need to stop at the boundary, get a COVID test done and are able to move ahead of course only after the test comes negative and that too only using the outer ring road. (It takes 1 day for the test reports to come)
    If a certain district is in Orange Zone, then preliminary tests are conducted whose results arrive in half a day and only if the results are negative can they travel ahead through the district using the outer ring road.
    If a district is in Green Zone, then they are just tested for temperature and if they are not feverish they can move ahead.
    Each day they can cross at max just 3 districts,

Ram and Shyam want to reach their destination as fast as possible preferably avoiding any red zone district and if possible the orange zones too. 

As they are not Computer Science students they have approached us to help them with this route finding problem.

Note that the Maharashtra state map for the Red/Orange/Green  is not static. So your problem would take in input about the Zones and then start to find route.

Formulate the problem and then write a code to solve it. Based on the above provided information you have to formulate the heuristic function (if you need it) and the path and step costs.
